# ‚úàÔ∏è ExitFlight: E-Ticket Generator & Booking Simulator

**ExitFlight is a full-stack application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a flight booking system, from selecting flights and inputting passenger details to generating dynamic PDF e-tickets and receiving email confirmations.**

This project serves as a practical demonstration of building a modern web application that incorporates a range of technologies, from frontend UI design to backend API development, database interaction, and external service integrations like PDF generation and email sending.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **‚úàÔ∏è Dynamic Flight Selection:**
    *   (Enhanced Version) Input origin, destination, and date to dynamically calculate estimated flight details using the **Haversine formula** for distance and realistic flight duration estimates.
    *   Select preferred airline and manually input flight number digits.
    *   Choose a cabin class (e.g., Economy, Business).

*   **üìù Comprehensive Passenger Details:**
    *   Secure and user-friendly forms for all necessary passenger information (title, name, contact, nationality).
    *   Robust client-side validation using **Zod**.
    *   Persistence of passenger details across browser sessions via `localStorage` for convenience.

*   **üìÑ Dynamic PDF E-Ticket Generation:**
    *   Generates professional-looking PDF e-tickets on the fly using `pdfkit`.
    *   **Airline-Specific Branding:** Customizes PDF appearance (borders, header colors, logos) based on the selected airline for a realistic touch.
    *   Includes all relevant flight info, passenger details, a unique booking reference, and generic travel advice.

*   **üìß Email Confirmation & Delivery:**
    *   Sends automated HTML email confirmations to the passenger with the generated PDF e-ticket attached.
    *   **Branded Emails:** Dynamically styles HTML email content (headers, buttons) using the selected airline's brand colors.
    *   Utilizes **Ethereal.email** for robust email testing in the development environment.

*   **üñ•Ô∏è Modern User Interface:**
    *   Clean, responsive, and intuitive UI built with **React** and **Vite**.
    *   Leverages **Shadcn/UI** components and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a polished look.
    *   A multi-step progress stepper guides users smoothly through the booking flow.

*   **‚öôÔ∏è Robust Backend & Data Flow:**
    *   **Node.js** and **Express.js** backend providing RESTful API endpoints.
    *   **Full TypeScript Stack:** End-to-end type safety for improved code quality and maintainability.
    *   **Shared Schemas:** Uses **Zod** for schema definition and validation on both the client and server.
    *   Currently uses an in-memory storage solution (`MemStorage`) for easy setup, with **Drizzle ORM** schemas defined for a straightforward migration to **PostgreSQL**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
*   npm, yarn, or pnpm
*   (Optional) A running PostgreSQL instance if you wish to use a real database.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yes/ExitFlight/app.git
    cd app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both the client and server:**
    *(This command assumes a root `package.json` script that installs for all workspaces. Adjust if your setup is different.)*
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables (for Backend):**
    *   Navigate to the `server` directory.
    *   Create a `.env` file by copying the example: `cp .env.example .env`.
    *   *(Note: The project is likely configured to run out-of-the-box with Ethereal email and in-memory storage, so no immediate changes may be needed.)*
    *   If you are connecting to PostgreSQL, add your database URL to the `.env` file:
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME"
        ```

4.  **Run Database Migrations (Optional - for PostgreSQL):**
    *   If using PostgreSQL, ensure your database is running and then apply the Drizzle schemas:
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit migrate
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start both the backend and frontend development servers:**
    From the **root** directory of the project:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`). The backend API will be running on a different port (e.g., 5000) and proxied by the frontend dev server.

## üìñ Usage

1.  Navigate to the flight selection page.
2.  Use the form to define your flight (real or imagined!).
3.  Click **"Preview Ticket"** to proceed to the passenger details form.
4.  Fill in the passenger details and submit.
5.  You will be redirected to a confirmation page.
6.  Check your Ethereal test inbox (a link will appear in your backend console) to see the confirmation email with the branded PDF e-ticket attached.
