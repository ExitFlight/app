FlightBack was developed to provide a hands-on experience in building a modern, full-stack web application flight selection process, input passenger details, and ultimately receive a dynamically generated PDF e-ticket and an email confirmation with the ticket attached.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of building a modern web application incorporating various technologies and features, from frontend user interface design to backend RESTful API endpoints.
    *   Manages data for airports, airlines, flights, passengers, and tickets.
    *   Currently uses an in-memory storage solution (`MemStorage`) for easy setup and demonstration, with Drizzle OR that mirrors real-world flight reservation systems. The project encompasses a user-friendly frontend for navigating the booking process and a robust API development, database interaction, and external service integrations like PDF generation and email sending.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (   **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **API Stylev18.x or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   PostgreSQL (Optional, if you plan steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
*   npm or:** RESTful
*   **PDF Generation:** PDFKit
*   **Email Sending:** Nodemailer (with Ethereal.email for to connect to a real database using the Drizzle schemas)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash yarn
*   PostgreSQL server (if you intend to use the database beyond `MemStorage`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone
    git clone https://github.com/jordanurbany/FlightBack.git
    cd FlightBack testing)
*   **Schema Validation (Server):** Zod
*   **(Planned/Schema-Ready) the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jordanurbany/FlightBack.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both client and server:**
    ```bash
    # Install root Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **(Planned/Schema-Ready) ORM:** Drizzle ORM
*   **(Current Demo
    cd FlightBack
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages for both client and server:**
    *, client, and server dependencies
    npm install 
    # If you have workspaces or prefer separate installs:
    # npm) Storage:** In-Memory Storage (`MemStorage`)

**Shared:**
*   **Schema Definition & Validation:** Z   Install root dependencies (if any, typically for running both concurrently):
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * install (in root)
    # cd client && npm install && cd ..
    # cd server && npm install && cd ..
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables (Backend):**
    *   Navigate to the `server`od (types and validation rules shared between frontend and backend)

**Development Tools:**
*   Vite (Frontend   The project might have a setup where `npm install` in the root also installs client/server dependencies, or you might need to directory.
    *   Create a `.env.local` file by copying from `.env.example` (if you provide build and dev server)
*   Nodemon (Backend auto-restarting)
*   tsx (TypeScript `cd` into respective directories. (Check your `package.json` scripts).
3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *    one) or create it manually.
    *   Add your `DATABASE_URL` if you are connecting to a PostgreSQL database: execution for Node.js)

## üéØ Project Goals & Learning Outcomes

This project was developed to:
*   Demonstrate proficiency in full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript development.
*   Implement a realistic, multi-step user workflow commonCreate a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.
    *   Add your PostgreSQL database connection string:
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_DB_USER:YOUR_DB_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOUR_DB_NAME"
        ```
    *   *(Note: For email testing with Ethereal as
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME"
        ```
    *   *(Note: For the current `MemStorage` setup, `DATABASE_URL` might not be strictly required for the in web applications.
*   Gain experience with dynamic document generation (PDFs) on the server-side.
*   Integr app to run, but the Drizzle schemas are designed for it.)*

4.  **Database Migrations (Ifate third-party services for functionalities like email sending.
*   Practice robust data validation and type safety using Zod and TypeScript.
*   Explore currently configured in `email-sender.ts`, no specific email env vars are strictly needed as it creates test accounts dynamically using PostgreSQL with Drizzle):**
    *   Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and the database exists.
    *   From. If you switch to a real SMTP provider, you'll add `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, modern frontend tooling and component-based UI development with React and Shadcn/UI.
*   Understand and implement API `SMTP_PASS` here.)*
4.  **Database Setup (if using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM):**
    *   Ensure the root or server directory (wherever your `drizzle.config.ts` is):
        ```bash
         design principles with Express.js.
*   (Future) Work with relational databases and ORMs like Drizzle. your PostgreSQL server is running and you've created the database.
    *   Run Drizzle migrations:
        ```bash
        npx drizzle-kit generate # Generate migration files
        npx drizzle-kit migrate  # Apply migrations to the database
        ```

        npx drizzle-kit migrate  # Apply migrations to your### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server & Frontend Dev Server Concurrently:**
    From the ** database
        ```
    *   *(Note: The project might also initialize with an in-memory store (`MemStorage`) byroot** directory of the project:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command ( recommended)
*   npm or yarn or pnpm
*   (Optional for database persistence) PostgreSQL server installed and running.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/usually defined in your root `package.json`) should typically start both the backend Node.js/Express server (often on a default, which doesn't require these DB steps for basic operation. Check `server/storage.ts` and `jordanurbany/FlightBack.git
    cd FlightBack
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for port like 5000 or 3001) and the frontend Vite dev server (often on portserver/index.ts` for how the storage is initialized.)*

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ``` both client and server:**
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm install
    # orbash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This should start both the backend server and the Vite frontend development server. Open 5173 or similar). Your Express server is likely configured to proxy frontend requests in development.

2.  **Access
    # cd client && npm install
    # cd ../server && npm install
    # (Depending on your package the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the Vite dev server (usually `http:// your browser to the address indicated (usually `http://localhost:5000` or similar).

---

##.json setup - if you have a root package.json that installs for both)
    ```
    *If you have separate `package.json` files in `client` and `server` folders, you'll need to `localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:5000` if fully proxied).

--- üìñ Usage

1.  Navigate to the flight selection page.
2.  Choose your departure and arrival airports, datenpm install` in each.*

3.  **Set up Environment Variables (Backend):**
